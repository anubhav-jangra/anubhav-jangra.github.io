This meetup was held under ML/AI Meetup programme under Developer Student's Club - IIT Patna. My presentation was based on the topic - "Multimodal Emoji Prediction", where I discussed the techniques utilized by Barbieri et al. 2018 to solve the [SemEval 2018 Task 2 (Multilingual Emoji Prediction)](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/17344). 
The presentation was followed by discussion on possible new techniques that can be implemented in this domain.
