Gave a talk on "Text summarization using encoder-decoder frameworks" at the PyData Conference held virtually at IIT Patna in collaboration with IEEE India. Due to the increasing about of data over the internet, preparing smart systems that can prepare gist of large text documents is becoming important. Hence, in this talk, I choose to speak on the topic of automatic abstractive text summarization using encoder-decoder frameworks. I'll prepare a short presentation about RNNs and these encoder-decoder frameworks, followed by a simple demo.
