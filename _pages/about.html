<p>(Last Updated: Oct 11, 2022)</p>

<p>I'm a Pre-doctoral Researcher at <a herf="https://research.google/locations/india/">Google Research India</a> in the Advertising Sciences team lead by <a href="https://research.google/people/107631/">Dr. Aravindan Raghuveer</a>. </p>

<p>I graduated from Indian Institute of Technogly (IIT) Patna with a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in Computer Science and Engineering. I was an active member of the <a href="https://www.iitp.ac.in/~ai-nlp-ml/">AI-NLP-ML Lab, IIT Patna</a> since July 2018, where I worked extensively on summarization, including extractive and abstractive text summarization, and multi-modal summarization. I also explored other research problems like complaint mining, neural machine translation, time series classification, and lexico-semantic relation analysis. </p>

<!-- My current supervisors include [Dr. Sriparna Saha](https://www.iitp.ac.in/~sriparna/) (Associate Professor, IIT Patna), [Dr. Pushpak Bhattacharyya](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/) (Professor, IIT Bombay), [Dr. Adam Jatowt](https://adammo12.github.io/adamjatowt/) (Associate Professor, Kyoto University), [Dr. GaÃ«l H. Dias](https://dias.users.greyc.fr/) (Professor, University of Caen Normandie), and [Dr. Mohammed Hasanuzzaman](https://mohammedhasanuzzaman.github.io/) (Lecturer, Cork Institute of Technology). -->

<p>My research interests include natural language processing (NLP) and multi-modal content processing. However, I'm always seeking out new research directions to explore, and am always looking forward to working with people from various cultures and backgrounds, and develop interesting real-world projects.</p>

<p><bold>Life aspiration</bold>: I wish to utilize my research experience to improve the current education landscape, contributing towards the fundamental <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/education/">right to education</a>.<p>
