<p>(Last Updated: Oct 20, 2024)</p>

<p> I am a second year CS Ph.D. student at Columbia University, working at the intersection of NLP+Education (check out <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04728">this survey</a> to know more). I'm fortunate to be advised by <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smara/">Dr. Smaranda Muresan</a>. </p>

<p>During the summer 2024, I interned at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/">Microsoft Research</a>+<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/office-of-applied-research/">Office of Applied Research</a> where I worked on style-personalized document generation for <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/welcome-to-copilot-in-word-2135e85f-a467-463b-b2f0-c51a46d625d1">MSWord CoPilot</a> with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/sjauhar/">Sujay Jauhar</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/basarraf/">Bahar Sarrafzadeh</a>, <a href="https://adewynter.github.io/">Adrian de Wynter</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/silviu/">Silviu Cucerzan</a>.</p>

<p> Before my PhD, I was working at <a href="https://research.google/locations/india/">Google Research India</a> as a pre-doctoral researcher in the Advertising Sciences team with <a href="https://research.google/people/107631/">Dr. Aravindan Raghuveer</a> and <a href="https://research.google/people/107624/">Dr. Preksha Nema</a> on text style transfer for creative ad generation. I received my undergraduate degree from <a href="https://www.iitp.ac.in/">IIT Patna</a>. I was an active member of the <a href="https://www.iitp.ac.in/~ai-nlp-ml/">AI-NLP-ML Lab, IIT Patna</a>, and worked on several facets of summarization (check out <a href="/publications">publications</a> for more). </p>

<!-- My current supervisors include [Dr. Sriparna Saha](https://www.iitp.ac.in/~sriparna/) (Associate Professor, IIT Patna), [Dr. Pushpak Bhattacharyya](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/) (Professor, IIT Bombay), [Dr. Adam Jatowt](https://adammo12.github.io/adamjatowt/) (Associate Professor, Kyoto University), [Dr. GaÃ«l H. Dias](https://dias.users.greyc.fr/) (Professor, University of Caen Normandie), and [Dr. Mohammed Hasanuzzaman](https://mohammedhasanuzzaman.github.io/) (Lecturer, Cork Institute of Technology). -->

<!-- <p>My research interests include natural language processing (NLP) and multi-modal content processing. However, I'm always seeking out new research directions to explore, and am always looking forward to working with people from various cultures and backgrounds, and develop interesting real-world projects.</p> --> 

<p><bold>Life aspiration</bold>: I wish to utilize my research experience to improve the current education landscape, contributing towards the fundamental <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/education/">right to education</a>.<p>

<p>I also am a member of the <a href="https://care-program.github.io">CARE program</a>. It is a <b>C</b>ommunity for <b>A</b>I <b>R</b>esearch and <b>E</b>ducation, where you can get in touch with highly-quallified mentors who can try to help out with your research-related queries.</p>
